### Commands

#### Zola commands

First, you need to create a new project and name it. Use the code below (without brackets):

> **zola init [name]**

If you already have a project you can open it with:

> **cd [name]**

If you want to go out of your project or some folder you can write:

> **cd ..**

You can see your folders, which were created automatically, if you type:

> **tree**

You can run a program, edit and look at results in real time with the code:

> **zola serve**

Your web server will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:1111** by default.<br>
Type this address in your browser and work in Powershell at the same time.<br>
Press "Ctrl"+"C" if you wanna quit.

#### Markdown commands

You might need [Markdown commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to create your own content in .md files:

write from a new line (no spaces needed)
> **< br >**

bold (no spaces needed)
> ** **word** **

<i>italic</i> (no spaces needed)
> **< i > word < /i >**

headings (without quotation marks)
> **"#" Title** <br> 
> **"##" Title** <br>
> **"###" Title** <br>

add a link (no space between brackets needed)
> **![Word_that_a_person_need_to_click_to_follow_your_link] (https://paste_your_url.com)**

add a picture (no space between brackets needed)
> **![you_can_leave_this_space_empty] (name_of_the_picture.png "Picture")** <br>
> **![you_can_leave_this_space_empty] (name_of_the_picture.jpg "Picture")**

### Programs

You may need a couple of apps in further to create files and download themes.<br>
Let's install them.

#### Let's install vim

You can install vim by yourself or using this [link](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases/download/v8.2.2825/gvim_8.2.2825_x86_signed.exe).
Check off the box next to "Create command bat-files". <br>
Now you can use vim in PowerShell!

#### Let's install git

You also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you want to use themes in further. It's easy. We are sure that you can do it without our help.

I promise that won't be that easy...

You need to go to the section [Installation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) on Zola website and find the operating system that you need. Windows is the most popular OS so we'll
show it as an example. Zola can be installed through [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). We'll use Scoop.

### Yes, you need to install Scoop first :(

Follow the link to [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) website, and you will see the title **Quickstart** with the code below.<br>
Its first line is optional: Needed to run a remote script the first time.

> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser <br>
> irm get.scoop.sh | iex

You need to copy the code above and paste it, for example, into [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), which you can find through **Search Bar** or the **Run Command (Win+R)**.
Open it. We know, the thing looks scary, and what's more, you'll need it to create your website, now just paste and press **Enter**. Something happened? Letters are not red?<br>

**Great! You installed Scoop!** <br>

Do you still remember why you are here? Wow, you not playing...

### Installing Zola

Your next step is to type the code below into Windows PowerShell (or console)

---
> scoop install zola

**Hooray! You installed Zola!** 

Now let's take a look at **useful commands, programs and links** in the **Step 2**
